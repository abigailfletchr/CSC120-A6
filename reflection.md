- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?

Well, it makes it more simple and complicated at the same time. I would say complicated, mostly because I am new to it haha. However, it is really clear how it works the way that in the constructors of the classes that extend the main class you have to initialize the variables in a super(); method. But, it makes a lot of sense, especially with this assignment. A building is the broad 'genre' then a house, library, and cafe are 'subsets' of the broad building 'genre'. I am still a bit fuzzy with the terminology but I understand the concept logistically, I think.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

This homework definitely seemed easier and it was super useful to word for word follow the ReadMe and reference the lecture slides when working through the homework. I think its because im getting better, but that first instruction was not as scary haha. Also, I feel like other times I skimmed the ReadMe and then freaked out because I did not know where to start but this time I really read it and felt better (which is a 'duhhhh' moment LOL). I would definitely suggest reviewing slides before jumping in especially when working with extending the classes.
